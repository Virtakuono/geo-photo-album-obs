# Geo-Photo-Album

This is a small script that allows to generate a small web page with a leaflet map with
popup messages from a folder of jpg images having geodata exif images.

This uses leaflet that is usable under its own
[license](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE),
the gen.py script is under
GNU GPL v2. If you want to use some other license, shoot an email to me and ask.
I will probably be okay with anything.
